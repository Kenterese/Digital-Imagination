Two Ways provided to generate GCODE:

1. Use Python program, image_to_gcode-master

Prerequisite of running the program:

Python 2.7 or higher

Opencv_python-2.4.12

*Opencv 3 only can run with Python 3




2. (recommend)(faster!) Use Inkscape we can preview the process of generating GCode

i. install Inkscape from its official website.
ii. Google and download JTP_Laser_Tool_V1_7, an extention for Inkscape generate Gcode to control the CNC plotter.  
(Remember to do edge detection for image before transformation.)

For Mac user,  XQuartz needs to be installed before running Inkscape.
